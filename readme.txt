Controls:
W, Space, or Up arrow: Jump
A or left arrow: Left
D or right arrow: Left

Goal:
Collect 5 coins (the little spinning squares) in the shortest amount of time.

Holding a direction against a wall while jumping or falling will cause you to slowly 
slide down the wall. During this time, you can press the jump button while still holding
the direction to perform a wall jump. Doing this in succession will allow you to scale 
any wall which is essential to beating this game. There is only one level at this time.
Have fun!
